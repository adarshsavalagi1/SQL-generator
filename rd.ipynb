       "  'content': \"The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described it in the late 19th century. Here's what happens:\\n\\nWhen sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light, so they scatter the light in all directions.\\n\\nThe shorter wavelengths of light, like blue and violet, are scattered more than the longer wavelengths, like red and orange. This is because the tiny molecules prefer to scatter the shorter wavelengths, which are traveling in a straight line, over the longer wavelengths that are deflected at an angle.\\n\\nAs a result, the blue light is distributed throughout the atmosphere, giving the sky its blue color. The reason we don't see more blue light than red light is that our eyes are less sensitive to the latter, and our brains tend to balance the two colors together to create the perception of a blue sky.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that the sky can appear different colors depending on the time of day, atmospheric conditions, and other factors. For example, during sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on hues of red, orange, and pink due to the scattering of light by atmospheric particles and dust.\"},\n",
